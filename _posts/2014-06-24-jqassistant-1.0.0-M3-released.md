jQAssistant 1.0.0-M3 is now available. Beside new scanners, rules and improved performance the most notable change is a SonarQube plugin. It allows to define and activate or deactive rules as a part of a quality profile on a SonarQube server and creating issues for violated constraints. You're strongly encouraged to try it!

For more information refer to the [release page](https://github.com/buschmais/jqassistant/releases/tag/1.0.0-M3) on GitHub and the [documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/{{ site.data.release.version }}).
