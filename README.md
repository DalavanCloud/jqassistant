## Contributions

Forks of the repository and pull requests are highly welcome! But we'd like to ask developers who intent to contribute to the project to 

- create an issue 
- or send an e-mail to the [jQAssistant forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jqassistant)

and to wait for comments from the maintainers before starting implementation works. This is for your safety to get the pull request accepted, it's always very sad for both sides to reject a PR because it does not fit. We promise that we try our best to give you feedback within the shortest time possible!
